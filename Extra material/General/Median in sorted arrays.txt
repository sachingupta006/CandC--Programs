Method 2 (By comparing the medians of two arrays)

This method works by first getting medians of the two sorted arrays and then comparing them.

Let ar1 and ar2 be the input arrays.

Algorithm:

1) Calculate the medians m1 and m2 of the input arrays ar1[]
   and ar2[] respectively.
2) If m1 and m2 both are equal then we are done.
     return m1 (or m2)
3) If m1 is greater than m2, then median is present in one
   of the below two subarrays.
    a)  From first element of ar1 to m1 (ar1[0...|_n/2_|])
    b)  From m2 to last element of ar2  (ar2[|_n/2_|...n-1])
4) If m2 is greater than m1, then median is present in one
   of the below two subarrays.
   a)  From m1 to last element of ar1  (ar1[|_n/2_|...n-1])
   b)  From first element of ar2 to m2 (ar2[0...|_n/2_|])
4) Repeat the above process until size of both the subarrays
   becomes 2.
5) If size of the two arrays is 2 then use below formula to get
  the median.
    Median = (max(ar1[0], ar2[0]) + min(ar1[1], ar2[1]))/2

Method 3 (By doing binary search for the median):

The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays ar1[] and ar2[] and know the length of each, you can check whether an element ar1[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is ar1[i]. Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i-1 values in array ar1[]. Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = n – i – 1 elements in ar2[].

It requires constant time to check if ar2[j] <= ar1[i] <= ar2[j + 1]. If ar1[i] is not the median, then depending on whether ar1[i] is greater or less than ar2[j] and ar2[j + 1], you know that ar1[i] is either greater than or less than the median. Thus you can binary search for median in O(lg n) worst-case time.

For two arrays ar1 and ar2, first do binary search in ar1[]. If you reach at the end (left or right) of the first array and don't find median, start searching in the second array ar2[].

1) Get the middle element of ar1[] using array indexes left and right.
   Let index of the middle element be i.
2) Calculate the corresponding index j of ar2[]
     j = n – i – 1
3) If ar1[i] >= ar2[j] and ar1[i] <= ar2[j+1] then ar1[i] and ar2[j]
   are the middle elements.
     return average of ar2[j] and ar1[i]
4) If ar1[i] is greater than both ar2[j] and ar2[j+1] then
     do binary search in left half  (i.e., arr[left ... i-1])
5) If ar1[i] is smaller than both ar2[j] and ar2[j+1] then
     do binary search in right half (i.e., arr[i+1....right])
6) If you reach at any corner of ar1[] then do binary search in ar2[]
